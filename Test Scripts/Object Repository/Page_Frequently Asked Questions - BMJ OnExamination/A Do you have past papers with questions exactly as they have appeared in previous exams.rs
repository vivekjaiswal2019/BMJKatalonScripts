	None of our resources contain past papers with questions exactly as they have appeared in previous exams 
 
	The questions in the actual exam are usually subject to Copyright. You will see this written on your exam paper and they may even announce it in the exam hall. A large number of eager candidates send us remembered question subjects and themes and this is a great help for us to keep in touch with the changing style and content of the exams. Although we could reconstruct the questions precisely we choose not to. We write questions based on those topics and in the same style as the exam but also commission questions on similar topics; some easier, some harder, some on newer research and some on older classical textbook features of the topic. 
 
	Learning from a varied resource is more challenging and will help you prepare for the exam in a more thorough way. Simply trying to remember the factual answers on questions from past papers so that you can spot them in the exam is foolhardy. In the actual exam questions may get changed from one year to the next and the correct answer can be moved by simply changing a few words in the case history; for example making one diagnosis more likely than another by changing the age of the patient. Many have felt that OnExamination.com has spotted questions in the exam papers and this is what helped them pass their exam. Although flattered we disagree. Those users were well prepared for the exam since the questions at OnExamination.com were in the same style, covered the same topics and covered the same range of difficulty as in the actual exam.
