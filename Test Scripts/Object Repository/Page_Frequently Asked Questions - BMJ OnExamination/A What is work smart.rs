                             'Work smart' allows you to define a series of questions to attempt where you select your exam, question type, category(s) and whether you have seen the question before or not. Learners will typically select 'all categories'. Given those criteria it then selects from the database questions that are suitable for your current level of performance. Using the detailed statistics collected from all other users and all your previous performance it predicts the odds of you being able to answer a particular question correctly. 

 This learning style is ideal for those who want to spread their revision over a longer period of time and it should give easier questions at the beginning of revision and harder questions towards the end. Your performance will always appear to be the same (it will average out to 50%) but your underlying exam performance will be improved. It is best suited for those who want to rely on the website to boost their ability and perhaps more interested in quality and not quantity of questions.  If you want to work through all of the questions in the database from start to finish, then you may find the 'Work Hard' learning style is a better choice.
