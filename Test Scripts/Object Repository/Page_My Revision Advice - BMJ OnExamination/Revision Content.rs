The MRCP Part 1 exam aims to test your knowledge and
understanding of basic medical science and common disorders, whilst
also assessing your problem solving skills.

The exam consist of two papers, each of which is 3 hours in
duration and contains 100 multiple choice questions in the form of
'best of five'. A 'best of five' question consists
of a brief scenario (the stem) and five statements (options) of
which one is the best answer. The detailed syllabus is published on
the MRCP website. The composition of the papers is show below:

Specialty Likely number of questions
 Cardiology 15
 Clinical pharmacology, therapeutics and toxicology 20
 Clinical sciences* 25
 Dermatology 8
 Endocrinology 15
 Gastroenterology 15
 Haemotology and oncology 15
 Neurology 15
 Ophthalmology 4
 Psychiatry 8
 Renal medicine 15
 Respiratory medicine 15
 Rheumatology 15

 *Clinical science comprises
 Cell, molecular and membrane biology 2
 Clinical anatomy 3

 Statistics, epidemiology and evidence-based medicine 5
 We strongly advise looking at the MRCP website for up to date
news, sample questions, and detailed information regarding the
marking scheme used for the exam.

The breadth of knowledge required to pass the MRCP part 1 exam
is large. You will need to have knowledge acquired from book work
as well as clinical experience. In addition to the knowledge,
getting used to the format of 'best of five' questions can
be difficult. Doing lots of past questions will help you develop
the skills required to answer this format, as well as help identify
the common question topics. You will learn more from the questions
you get wrong if you make an effort to read around the themes of
each question and learn the key points set out in the answer
explanation. The Revision Progress area of your BMJ OnExamination
account keeps you updated on your performance, and will help
highlight the areas you need to concentrate on prior to your
exam.

The following tips may help you answer 'best of five'
questions:

Read the question first and try to answer it without looking at
the options. By trying to think of the correct answer first you
will be less likely to be fooled by a wrong answer.
 Make sure you read all the options. Don't just accept the
first correct one you see. Often answering a 'best of five'
question depends on judging two similar options, either of which
could be the best answer.
 Do not spend too much time on a single question. It is easy to
spend a lot of time deliberating over one question, which may mean
you have to rush the others. It is your overall performance which
matters, so don't worry too much about individual tricky
questions.
 Do not keep changing your answer. Research suggests that the first
answer you choose is usually the correct one.
 If the answer isn't immediately obvious first eliminate the
options you know are false. This will improve your chances of
guessing.
 If you find yourself having to guess, go with your gut feeling
even if you can't think of a reason. If you have prepared well,
there is a good chance you will be correct.
 Finally, remember there is no substitute for practice so start
early and try to do lots of past questions. But don't get
over-stressed and ensure that you relax the night before the exam,
have a good breakfast and arrive to the venue with plenty of
time.

Good luck with your exam, and we hope you to see you back for
help with your Part 2 exam soon!
